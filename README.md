# ArtVista

## Introduction
We're going to work on building an artVista application, that showcases projects! We want our site visitors to be able to view, add, edit, and delete their own projects and profiles.

### Landing Page
As a site visitor, I want to be greeted by an appealing landing/ hero page, so I can get a quick overview of what artVista is about and feel encouraged to explore more.

### Home Page
As a registered user, I want to see a personalized homepage with a feed of recent and popular projects, so I can discover new artworks and get inspiration.

### Registration, Login and Logout
As a new user, I want to be able to register for an account using my name, email, username and create a password, so I can start showcasing and interacting with projects.

As an existing user, I want to log in securely using my username and password, so I can access my account and manage my projects.
As an logged-in user I should have the option to logout of my current session

### User Profile Settings
As a user, I want to update my profile information and upload a profile picture, so others can learn more about me and my projects. I should be able to change my username, update my email

### Project Listing and Ranking
As a user, I want to view a list of all projects, sorted by date or rating,  so I can easily find projects that are performing well and newly added ones . I want to also be able to search (filter) for projects that have specific tags

As a user, I want to rank projects by rating them on a scale of 1 - 5, 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. I should also have the ability to include my comments, so I can express my appreciation and influence the project's visibility, as well as engage in discussions with other users.

### Manage Projects
As a user, I want to add a new project with a title, description, and images, so I can showcase my work to the community.

As a user, I want to edit the details of my projects, so I can update information and improve the presentation as needed.

As a user, I want to delete my projects, so I can remove work that is no longer relevant or that I no longer wish to display.
